## Reinforcement Learning Using Q-Learning in a Predator/Prey Agent-Based Model with NetLogo and PyTorch 

Agent-based modeling is way of designing computational models from the perspective of individual autonomous agents to study how the behavior of systems as a whole are determined by the interactions between agents and other elements of the system.

[NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) is a programming language and modeling environment created and maintained by the [CCL Lab](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/) at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/).

Predator/Prey systems are an ecological phenomenon that can be easily modeled using agent-based modeling (ABM.)

The image below is from a popular NetLogo model WolF/Sheep Predation.
