## Reinforcement Learning Using Q-Learning in a Predator/Prey Agent-Based Model with NetLogo and PyTorch 

Agent-based modeling is way of designing computational models from the perspective of individual autonomous agents to study how the behavior of systems as a whole are determined by the interactions between agents and other elements of the system. [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) is a programming language and modeling environment created and maintained by the [CCL Lab](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/) at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu/). Predator/Prey systems are an ecological phenomenon that can be easily modeled using agent-based modeling (ABM.) Typically in these models, the behaviors of the predator and prey agents are determined by fairly simple heuristics (often time pure randomness.) The aim of this project is to embedded reinforcement learning models into both the predator agents and the prey agents in a predator/prey ABM in NetLogo. NetLogo includes a Python extension which allows us to interact with external Python code from within a NetLogo model-and more importantly to use machine learning libraries such as PyTorch. We have created a few different NetLogo models and a Q-learning model in PyTorch that we use in this project to conduct our experiments.
